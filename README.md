# Arachadmin

This is a web2py tool for managing information going into arachnolingua via a MySQL database.  OwlBuilder (https://github.com/pmidford/owlbuilder) is
accompanying tool to generate owl/rdf from the database.

## Installation

1. Install prerequisites.  On MacOS, I recommend using homebrew (http://brew.sh/), and consider installing the latest python 2.7.x (web2py doesn't support python3 at this time).  Also install pip from http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/.

Currently the only prerequisite for arachadmin is lxml.  On ubuntu, you might be able to just use 'apt-get install -y python-pip'; otherwise use:

<pre>
</pre>

2. Install MySQL.

3. Configure MySQL.

4. Download and install web2py.  The current version of arachadmin runs with version 2.5.1.

5. Get the current backend dumpe from figshare.
